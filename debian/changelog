  * Update to latest standards version.
  * Update to latest libqt3-mt-dev.
  * The bug #300683 is closed by the existence of the 'oprofile-source'
    package.  If a 2.[24].x kernel is used, it will be necessary to build
    your own kernel module; 'oprofile-source' provides the module source.
    For 2.6.x kernels, the module is built by default and included in the
    standard Debian kernel images.  Hence, the goofy pbuilder change listed
    in the previous entry has been removed and the bug closed via another
    mechanism -- you need to build your own oprofile kernel modules.

oprofile (0.6.1-3) unstable; urgency=low

  * Since we can't know what kernel is in use, relaxed the dependency
    on oprofile-modules<n> to a Recommends.  E.g., in 2.6 kernels,
    the OProfile kernel module is in the kernel and could already be
    built and available.
  * Added dependency on binutils-dev (for libbfd.so) to oprofile-modules<n>
  * The oprofile-modules-* packages incorrectly included a dependency on
    automake and kernel-package (they are needed in Build-Depends, though).
  * oprofile-source was missing a dependency on automake1.7, binutils-dev
  * Changed the Makefile.am files for ./dae and ./daemon to remove the
    test on whether or not --with-kernel-support was used (but left
    this in the configure step in debian/rules to force the configure
    to _not_ look for kernel source since the kernel modules will be
    built by a different process).  This forces both a 2.4 oprofiled
    daemon (./dae/oprofiled) and a 2.5 daemon (./daemon/oprofiled)
    to be built.  At the same time, these now get installed as daemons
    with different names, and oprofiled becomes a wrapper script that
    invokes the right daemon for the right kernel.
  * Added a note to README.Debian about the need to use install_vmlinux
    when building a kernel image with make-kpkg, if you want to profile
    the kernel.
  * oprofile-source now conflicts with known 2.6 kernel packages

oprofile (0.6.1-2) unstable; urgency=low

  * Improved the text in README.Debian; better wording, "user-space"
    instead of the more informal (and possibly unclear) "user-land,"
    and consistent capitalization of "OProfile."
  * Improved the text in the package descriptions; better wording
    and consistent capitalization of "OProfile."
  * oprofile-source package was needed a Depends (not just a
    Build-Depends) for automake(>=1.6) and binutils-dev.
  * The kernel module build needed to put the .deb in /usr/src
    instead of /usr/src/modules.
  * Updated the build dependency for libqt3-dev (since it's been
    deprecated, or may be soon) to libqt3-mt-dev.

  * Cleaned up the commentary in debian/rules
  * Cut away the cruft from debian/configure.modules.in (it's a subset

  * Tested kernel module build environment using debootstrap to build a
    chroot environment; rewrote portions of debian/rules to be cleaner,
    fixed up the module control file build-depends.
  * Added HOWTOs for ia64 and i386 to the docs provided by the

    able to build kernel modules separately

oprofile (0.5.3-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * Updated to latest released upstream source; 0.5.2 and 0.5.3, unlike
    previous releases, seem to be fairly cooperative, with just incremental
    changes instead of the earlier wholesale replacements.
  * Added in a copy of the Release Notes from the web site, as part of
    the documentation.
  * Made sure release notes went with both packages produced (oprofile
    _and_ oprofile-sources).
  * Made sure AUTHORS file was included.

 -- Al Stone <ahs3@debian.org>  Fri, 13 Jun 2003 12:25:17 -0600

oprofile (0.5.2-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * Update to latest released version.  NB: as seems to be normal, this
    version conflicts with prior versions, so dependencies needed updating.
  * Added support for ia64 version.
  * Cleaned up some of the copyright info, added AUTHORS file.
  * Added in a copy of the Release Notes from the web site, as part of
    the documentation.

 -- Al Stone <ahs3@debian.org>  Fri, 13 Jun 2003 12:15:49 -0600

oprofile (0.4-5) unstable; urgency=low

  * Added dependency on libpopt-dev for oprofile-source (it was missing). 

 -- Al Stone <ahs3@debian.org>  Mon, 24 Mar 2003 10:41:16 -0700

oprofile (0.4-4) unstable; urgency=low

  * Forgot to make sure that the original source and the diff file
    were included (!)
  * Packaging done. Closes: #139475

 -- Al Stone <ahs3@debian.org>  Fri, 21 Mar 2003 21:07:43 -0700

oprofile (0.4-3) unstable; urgency=low

  * Corrected the description to refer to kernel-package as it should,
    and use the right name for oprofile-modules (not oprofile-modul*e*).
  * Moved some warnings from debconf to README.Debian so that they are
    more readily accessible.  Based on suggestions, did some significant
    rewording of the text to make clearer what's being said.
  * The oprofile-source kernel module build relied on `uname -r` when
    it should not have.  The problem was that you could build the module
    in a chroot environment and have it install in the wrong modules
    directory.
  * The build was kind of messed up; even when all you were doing was
    the build of the user-land components, configure was looking for
    things like kernel headers that are only needed when building the
    kernel module.  Fixed the rules file to configure properly depending
    on what we're building.
  * A debian/dirs file was being created for the kernel module and was
    mistakenly creating module directories it should not have.
  * Cleaned up the oprofile build-depends to be accurate.

oprofile (0.4-2) unstable; urgency=low

  * Bug report from the oprofile mailing list says that libpp.a is not
    to be installed at all, so removed it from the installation step

 -- Al Stone <ahs3@debian.org>  Mon, 11 Nov 2002 11:11:00 -0700

oprofile (0.4-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * Update to latest upstream 
  * Had to fix makefile in pp directory to install libpp.a in /usr/lib
    instead of /usr/bin.

 -- Al Stone <ahs3@debian.org>  Fri,  8 Nov 2002 13:52:58 -0700

oprofile (0.3-3) unstable; urgency=low

  * Cleanup problems with debian/Makefile.modules.in (install steps were
    all wrong, leftovers from prior version)

 -- Al Stone <ahs3@debian.org>  Fri,  8 Nov 2002 11:20:04 -0700

oprofile (0.3-2) unstable; urgency=low

  * Cleaned up debian/rules so make-kpkg works *correctly*; was using
    the wrong paths for kernel header and source files.
  * Added in the configure.modules.in file to be used by the make-kpkg
    build as it's configure.in; needed to remove all the dependencies
    that aren't needed.
  * Moved Makefile.modules.in and configure.modules.in to the debian
    directory since that's the only place that uses them (in make-kpkg).
  * Added debconf warning to oprofile-source; wanted to make sure that
    you knew that a make clean will be done in your kernel source directory
    when you do a make-kpkg.

 -- Al Stone <ahs3@debian.org>  Wed,  6 Nov 2002 16:55:10 -0700

oprofile (0.3-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * Upgrade to 0.3 upstream; this forces some dependency touch-up
  * Rules file for make-kpkg module build was retaining values from
    an initial config done during the creation of the package and was
    not using the variable values provided by make-kpkg
  * Added build dependency on libpopt-dev (it was missing)
  * Cleaned up debian/rules to accomodate changes since 0.2

 -- Al Stone <ahs3@debian.org>  Wed,  6 Nov 2002 16:22:25 -0700

oprofile (0.2-6) unstable; urgency=low

  * Bug: improved the way configure.in looked for kernel header files;
    it's not foolproof, but will probably work better for those that use
    the Debian kernel image/header/source packages.

 -- Al Stone <ahs3@debian.org>  Mon,  4 Nov 2002 14:07:12 -0700

oprofile (0.2-5) unstable; urgency=low

  * Added the events directory to the kernel module source package so
    it will compile
  * Added the util directory to the kernel module source package so
    it will compile
  * Added the dae directory to the kernel module source package so
    it will compile
  * Added a Makefile.modules.in so that make-kpkg would work properly
    (it only needs a subset of the entire source tree; this subset of
    Makefile.in compiles the subset).
  * The "Recommends" should have been "Suggests" in the control files
  * Changed the name of the virtual package oprofile-modules so that
    it includes the version number; dpkg cannot handle virtual package
    versioning well, so this makes sure we have the right modules.

 -- Al Stone <ahs3@debian.org>  Tue, 20 Aug 2002 15:57:59 -0600

oprofile (0.2-4) unstable; urgency=low

  * Completely re-vamped the way this package is built and
    structured, using some new templates for dh_make specific
    to kernel module type packages.

 -- Al Stone <ahs3@debian.org>  Mon, 19 Aug 2002 16:34:19 -0600

oprofile (0.2-3) unstable; urgency=low

  * Removed some of the remaining kernel stuff configure.in from
    the user-land only package; oprofile-module will have all the
    kernel stuff in it.

 -- Al Stone <ahs3@debian.org>  Fri, 16 Aug 2002 13:44:43 -0600

oprofile (0.2-2) unstable; urgency=low

  * Package cleanup: (1) fix man page problems, (2) clean up rules
    file, (3) added depends on kernel module
  * Removed/commented out the steps that build and install the kernel
    module; those will be in a separate kernel modules package
  * Added some missing links for man pages
  * xsltproc was being invoked to create doc/oprofile.html but was
    producing a zero-length file.  fixed the make to create the
    html properly.

 -- Al Stone <ahs3@debian.org>  Fri, 16 Aug 2002 11:14:29 -0600

oprofile (0.2-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * Initial Release.

 -- Al Stone <ahs3@debian.org>  Wed, 14 Aug 2002 18:03:29 -0600
